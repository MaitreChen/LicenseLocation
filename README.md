Hi,everyone!
This is my first project!
Actually,this is an assignment from my digital image processing experiment class.


Through thinking about algorithm ideas and the process of constantly adjusting parameters by myself, I successfully completed this project.

You can clone this project to local and run it.
Now,here is something to tell you:
First,the "test.jpg" is the original image,and the "img.jpg" is a picture that i preprocessed.Among them,I used OTSU and morphological operations.

Second,when you run "segment.py".
