## Here is a manually implemented grayscale histogram.

At the time of writing, I used the "src", that is a 6X6 array to realize the program.

Now, I imported a test image. When you run the "source.py",you can find two windows like this:

![image-20220114165837554](C:\Users\19749\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220114165837554.png)

 <This is the drawing result of calling the function directly>

![image-20220114165849332](C:\Users\19749\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20220114165849332.png)

<This is what I did manually.>

The effect is ideal, because the algorithm is relatively simple. 

If there is any inappropriate place, please correct me.
